                  DDMRP is different. It is challenging some deep truths that have been around for a long time. Changing mindsets of people
                  from the CEO to the shop floor worker is difficult and nothing helps more than demonstrable results.
                  <br/>
                  <br/> In order to introduce your team to the new methods and to demonstrate clear results, B2Wise suggests all
                  clients start with a pilot project. This pilot project is a small scale project on a limited set of data.
                  It is normally carried out on purchased or distributed parts. As a part of the pilot, B2Wise will connect
                  our application to your ERP system.
                  <br/>
                  <br/> Apart from demonstrating results, this pilot projects also affords the client the opportunity to understand
                  what transformations will be required, sddress master data deficiencies, design new process and work flows,
                  Identify training requirements and get the thought-ware of the organisation right.
